- Redirect... whats up with that?
- Can the PROJECT have it's own views? i.e. index.html?
--- I should maybe scrap the tabsapp app, esp if yes to above.
- Custom User Models - yay or nay?
- Should I have used crispy-forms? (Geeks for Geeks tutorial for e.g.)
- How are sessions handled in a typical Django SSR app? ('you are logged in...')
- VSCode is currently formatting my html template files annoyingly...

- Most wanted:
---- use postgres
---- implement a custom user model (email, no username for e.g)
---- use django-crispy-forms (maybe)
---- email confirmation signup (see geeks for geeks)
-------- use mailhog
---- use django-allauth (maybe)
---- use django-rest-framework AND standard SSR pages together
